Include a brief description of the program and any great features we want them to notice. Save as a pdf.

How We Handled Sorting

	Our program takes in input as stdin and then calls a function to create and linked list and another function to 


Sorting Algorithm

- head, ptrA, ptrB are Node pointers

	if ptrA has another node after:
		if ptrA == ptrB == head:
			if n needs to go before head:
				n->next = head;
				head = n;
			else:
				ptr = ptrA->next;
		else:
			if n needs to go before ptrA:
				ptrB->next = n;
				n->next = ptrA;
			else:
				ptrA = ptrA->next;
				ptrB = ptrB->next;
		else:
		if n needs to go before ptrA:
			ptrB->next = n;
			n->next = ptrA;
		else:
			ptrA->next = n;
